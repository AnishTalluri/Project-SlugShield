# Project-SlugShield
Our "Edge AI Intrusion Detector" is a lightweight, on-device IDS that simulates edge monitoring in software. It watches local IoT and smart-device traffic and uses ML to spot unusual ports, data bursts, or odd packet patterns. Everything runs offline for privacy, with encrypted alerts, hashed logs, and a live web dashboard.
