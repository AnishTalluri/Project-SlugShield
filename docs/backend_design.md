- ids_backend(Backend logic):
    - requirements.txt: a txt file that should be ran when creating an environment for this project-- it contains the modules with the version for each of those modules to make this project work
    - ids_backend: The directory where all the backend logic will be stored: parsing, detecting, etc.
        - config.py: Loader and manager of configuration for project-- reads config.yaml and merge with defaults
        - dectectors: directory that will contain files that detect the icmp flood, arp spoofing, etc. 
            - icmp_flood.py: ICMP flood detection that utilizes sliding windows-- if the threshold value for number of ICMP packets within another threshold value for sliding window length in seconds is met, then trigger alert 
                - Detects for both ipv4 and ipv6-- sends the ip address, packet count, and window value to alert 
        - capture.py: captures the packets using scapy-- note(Andy-- ICMP flooding): im not using bpf just cause it isn't the most reliable in filtering packets: it will take up more cpu usage just cause it's not filtering only for certain packets but will turn it on when deployed in the wild
        - centralized_detector.py: base class for all specific detectors-- inherit from centralized_detector
        - alerting.py: add to alerts.log on what was detected along with the timestamp
