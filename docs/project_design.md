- First thing is first, make sure you:
    - Are in the directory for this project 
    - Create an environment for testing: python3 -m venv venv
    - Activate environment: source venv/bin/activate(Please make sure to not push venv onto github-- no need to)
    - Download the packages needed for backend: pip install -r requirements.txt
        - Side Note: Some of these packages require the latest python update to run

- config.yaml: user-editable configuration-- you change threshold values and such here 
- run_backend.py: run the actual backend of the project
- tools
    - simulate_icmp_flood.py: sends a range of icmp packets to the detector
- requirements.txt
    - scapy: packet capture and network traffic analysis
    - fastapi: web api backend framework -> exposes data to frontend
    - uvicorn[standard]: runs the FastAPI backend, [standard] is for performance extra
    - python-dotenv: stores confirguration values in an environment file
    - pytest: for automated and integration testing
    - PyYAML: reading structured .yaml configs
- How to test for:
    - icmp flood: have two terminals open: for for victim and one for attacker
        - You can test this locally, just set interface to lo0
        - On victim's terminal run: sudo -E venv/bin/python3 run_backend.py 
        - On attacker's terminal run: sudo -E venv/bin/python3 tools/simulate_icmp_flood.py 127.0.0.1 1000
